# karma-electron-launcher [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/karma-electron-launcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/karma-electron-launcher) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/urgpvcip7kl9q2ih?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/twolfson/karma-electron-launcher)

[Karma][] launcher for [Electron][]

This was written to allow for directly testing in [Electron][] where we might want `require` to work automatically

[Karma]: https://github.com/karma-runner/karma
[Electron]: https://github.com/atom/electron

**Features:**

- Tested via CI on Linux and Windows
- Support for Node.js integration in the renderer process (e.g. `process`, `require`, `__filename`)
- Support for hidden browser windows
- Support for isolated test runs to prevent cookie/localStorage pollution

## Getting Started
On a project that has been set up with `karma init` already, install the module via:

```bash
# Install our module and `electron-prebuilt`
npm install karma-electron-launcher electron-prebuilt
```

Then, configure the module:

```js
// Inside `karma.conf.js`
browsers: ['Electron']

// If you would like Node integration support (e.g. `require`)
//   then, you must include this as the first file in `files`:
files: [
    require.resolve('karma-electron-launcher/lib/node-integration-iframe.js'),
    // Tests go here (e.g. 'test/*.js')
]
```

Then, we can run Karma:

```bash
karma start
```

> The `require.resolve` in `files` is necessary due to Karma using an `iframe` and Electron's `nodeIntegration` only applying to the top level window. This file implements the missing `nodeIntegration` capabilities.
>
> Alternative solutions/discussions are welcome via issues/PRs. We believe it might be possible via Karma's dependency injection (e.g. `config.files`).

## Documentation
### Environment variables
- ELECTRON_BIN - Override path to use for `electron`
    - By default, we will use path given by `electron-prebuilt`

### Configuration
We support configuration via Karma's custom launcher inheritance:

- flags `Array` - List of Chromium flags to alter Electron's behavior
    - https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/v0.36.9/docs/api/chrome-command-line-switches.md
    - We added support for a `--show` to allow making the Karma window visible
- userDataDir `String` - Directory to store cookies/localStorage information
    - By default, this is a random directory generated by Karma (e.g. `/tmp/karma-5355024`)

**Example:**

```
module.exports = function (config) {
  config.set({
    // Specify usage of our custom launcher
    browsers: ['CustomElectron'],

    // Define a custom launcher which inherits from `Electron`
    customLaunchers: {
      CustomElectron: {
        base: 'Electron',
        userDataDir: __dirname + '/.electron',
        flags: ['--show']
      }
    }
};
```
